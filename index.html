    <p class="container">Hello, my name is Ilda Martinez, A bilingual Computer Science student with research and industry experience in AI, Machine Learning, and Information Technology. I just graduated school at <a href="https://www.csusb.edu/">California State University of San Bernardino</a>. I completed my Bachelors degree in CS in May of 2025.<br><br> 
    I am a dedicated and detail-oriented individual with a passion for technology and a strong desire to learn. I have experience in software development, data analysis, and machine learning. My skills include Python, C/C++, HTML/CSS, .NET/MAUI, and powershell. I also have experience with various machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow and Scikit-learn. Finally I have a background in security and plan on doing security certifications to familiarize myself in the field and preventing future threats. <br><br>
    I have experience in Machine Learning through my work with <a href="https://yesweinspect.com/">We Inspect</a>, where I collaborated with a team of students from various schools to develop a predictive model for detecting mold in homes using Python and ML libraries. Additionally, I conducted AI security research at <a href="https://action.ucsb.edu/">UC Santa Barbara</a> ,identifying vulnerabilities in public chatbots on websites. I also worked briefly in IT support at Ingram Micro, where I imaged, configured, troubleshoted, and assembled computers, ensuring seamless system operations. I am eager to expand my network and make meaningful contributions in AI, healthcare, and software development. With a quick learning ability and adaptability, I seek opportunities to apply my skills to drive project success. Committed to lifelong learning, I am excited to grow in an innovative and dynamic professional environment.<br><br>
    My current interests are looking for internships or entry-level positions in software development, data analysis, or machine learning. If you are interested in connecting or have any opportunities available, please feel free to reach out to me via email at <a href="mailto: ildamartinez274@gmail.com">ildamartinez274@gmail.com</a>.
